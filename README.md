# About Me

I am a full stack software developer looking to further my skills and meet people in the tech industry.

My most recent commits will be a bit patchy due to working in groups and computer sharing over the past few months.

Some of my passions include tech, travel, psychology, music, languages, conservation and education.

# Ongoing proects 

### GlassHomes

My role in this project was product owner with a focus on the front end, as well as helping the team with the back-end.

### Acousta-Search

A personal project to create an acoustic guitar search engine to allow guitar nerds to search for guitars by specific dimensions, wood, neck width and more.

### Pomodoro Timer
